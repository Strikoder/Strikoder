What's up? I'm just another human trying to make sense of Deep Learning, and yes, obsessing over Neovim because why not? 

- **Peek at My Projects**: Swing by my [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/strikoder) to see me tinker with data or take a stroll through my [GitHub](https://github.com/Strikoder/DS-ML-DL/tree/main/Projects/Machine%20&%20Deep%20learning%20projects) where I stash all my ML & DL experiments.
